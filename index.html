        Following the non-existent theatrical releases due to COVID-19 pandemic, 
        the film was later planned for a digital release through the streaming
         services Netflix and JioCinema, with the scheduled date of 30 July 2021. 
         However, the film was released through the platforms on 26 July 2021,
          four days before the scheduled release as the film was released 
          accidentally by Jio Cinema and went into torrent sites.[2] 
          The film received mixed reviews from the film critics, who praised
           Sanon and Tripathi's performance, with many stating the role as the career
            best performance of Sanon but criticized the film for its contrived plot.[3]
